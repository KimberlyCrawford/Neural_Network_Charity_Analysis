## Results

Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.


Data Preprocessing
1) What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
2) What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
3) What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
4) How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
5) Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
6) What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
